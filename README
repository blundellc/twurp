twurp -- dump twitter statuses into a database.

what it does:
    snarfs twitter statuses and dumps them in a database.

    first time twurp is run on a new screen name, twurp will attempt to get all
    previous statuses, and save them into a database.  upon subsequent
    executions, twurp will try to get all statuses since the last in the
    database.

usage:
	twurp.py [<screen name> [<number of most recent statuses to show>]]

by default you will find the sqlite database in:

    ~/.local/share/twurp/twurp.sqlite

requires sqlalchemy and the python twitter package.

under Debian:
    # apt-get install python-twitter python-sqlalchemy
