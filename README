twurp -- snarf twitter statuses into a database.

what it does:

    the first time twurp is run on a new screen name, twurp will attempt to get
    all previous statuses and save them into a database.  subsequently, twurp
    will try to get all statuses since the last in the database.

usage:
	twurp.py [<screen name> [<number of most recent statuses to show>]]

by default you will find the sqlite database in:

    ~/.local/share/twurp/twurp.sqlite

requires sqlalchemy and the python twitter package.

under Debian:
    # apt-get install python-twitter python-sqlalchemy
